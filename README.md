ArcExtractor
============
This script extracts a dBase table (.dbf), a comma separated file (.csv), or a tab separated file (.tsv) for every instance of a value in a specific field. This is useful for moving data between ArcMap and an older program or if you need to move GIS data into several spreadsheets for analysis.

V. 1.0.0
