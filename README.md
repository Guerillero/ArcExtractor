ArcExtractor
============
This script extracts a dBase table (.dbf), a comma separated file (.csv), or a tab separated file (.tsv) for every instance of a value in a specific field. This is useful for moving data between ArcMap and an older program or if you need to move GIS data into several spreadsheets for analysis.

V. 1.0.0
-----------
This has been tested in ArcMap 10.2 and 10.3 and works, other versions of ArcMap may not have similar results. I have no plans to develop this project any further beyond routine bugfixes.

Dependencies
-----------
* `arcpy`
* `dbfread`
* `csv`
