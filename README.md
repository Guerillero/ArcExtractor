ArcExtractor
============

This script extracts a dBase table (.dbf) for every instance of a value in a specific field. To use, change `$FieldName` on line 61 to the field you want to extract by. Then create a text file matching the provided example. Finally, run the provided ArcToolbox in ArcMap.

This was tested in ArcMap 10.2.1 and may not work with other versions of the software. Please let me know about any bugs.
