ArcExtractor
============
This script extracts a dBase table (.dbf) or a comma separated file (.csv) for every instance of a value in a specific field. This is useful for moving data between ArcMap and an older program or if you need to move GIS data into several spreadsheets for analysis.

<h3>V. 0.2.0</h3>
Changes:
* Added CSV support
* Speed fixes
* Updated to PEP style

This was tested in ArcMap 10.2.1 and may not work with other versions of the software. Please let me know about any bugs.

<h4>Dependencies</h4>

* `dbfread`
* `csv`

<h3>Developmental version</h3>
Excel support is coming in v0.3.0

<h3>Colophon</h3>
